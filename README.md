# Team Name: ProfFinder

This AI-powered Rate My Professor website allows users to obtain detailed insights into a professor's teaching style, grading tendencies, and overall ratings based on data scraped from RateMyProfessor. Users can enter a professor's RateMyProfessor link, and the site leverages a custom-built web scraping system to extract data such as ratings, student comments, and other key metrics. This data is then analyzed by a generative AI-powered chatbot, which answers user questions and provides insights based on real student feedback, including average grades, common student concerns, and the professor's strengths.

The software is built using Next.js, React, and Firebase for frontend functionality, while the backend leverages Spring Boot and the OpenAI API (through DeepInfra). The application also includes a user authentication system using Firebase, allowing users to save their chat history with the chatbot and rename chats for easy reference.
